# Search on Github API: React & Redux

This SPA was created using React and Redux. With it you can browse through Github's API and retrieve information on users and their repos

The project was created using webpack. I have done the setting from scratch. 

This is also my first project using Redux, so I went through a huge learning curve to do this in more or less one week. 

I also decided to use a new UI library, that is called [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/). It is a pretty simple one to use even though a bit limited. I used this opportunity to try it but I wouldn't use this in future projects again.
